# HOW TO USE BLACKJACK FINAL.EXE by Vincent VOISIN
The README.txt file you are reading came with a .zip folder. In this .zip folder is an application called "BlackjackFinal.exe". This application is the game.

To open the game, simply double-click on the application. This will bring you to a Title Screen with a yes or no question. Answer N to exit the program, Y to advance. A list of 3 options will appear. Input 1 to read the rules of BlackJack, 2 to play the game, and 3 to exit the program.

In the rules, the program will ask you if you want to go back to the previous screen. Answering Y will do so, answering N will exit the program.

As for the game itself: You start with 500.00 euros. You bet on each game but watch out, having no more money in the bank will make you lose. To hit, you have to input H. To stay, you have to input S.

After winning or losing the game, the program will ask if you want to play another one. Answer Y to start another game, N to exit the program.
